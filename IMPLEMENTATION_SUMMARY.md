# Copy with Link Plugin - New Implementation Summary

## Overview
The plugin has been completely rewritten to implement a new approach that addresses the CSS styling challenges with inline callouts.

## New Behavior

### What Happens When You Select Text:
1. **Text Selection**: User selects any text (single line, multi-line, or across paragraphs)
2. **Paragraph Detection**: Plugin finds all paragraphs that contain any part of the selection
3. **Highlighting**: Selected text portions are wrapped in `==highlight==` marks
4. **Callout Wrapping**: Each affected paragraph is wrapped in an `> [!inline-quote]` callout with a unique ID
5. **Clipboard Copy**: Original selection + block links are copied to clipboard

### Examples:

#### Single Paragraph Selection:
**Before:**
```
This is a paragraph with some selected text in the middle.
```

**After (selecting "selected text"):**
```
> [!inline-quote] This is a paragraph with some ==selected text== in the middle.
> ^abc123
```

#### Multi-Paragraph Selection:
**Before:**
```
First paragraph with some text.

Second paragraph with more text.
```

**After (selecting "text" from first + "Second paragraph" from second):**
```
> [!inline-quote] First paragraph with some ==text==.
> ^abc123

> [!inline-quote] ==Second paragraph== with more text.
> ^def456
```

## Technical Implementation

### Core Functions:
1. **`findAffectedParagraphs()`** - Detects paragraph boundaries using empty lines
2. **`createHighlightedParagraph()`** - Applies `==highlight==` marks to selected portions
3. **`paragraphIntersectsSelection()`** - Determines if a paragraph contains part of the selection
4. **`getParagraphText()`** - Extracts text from paragraph line ranges

### Key Features:
- **Precise Highlighting**: Only selected text gets highlighted, not entire paragraphs
- **Multi-Paragraph Support**: Each paragraph gets its own callout with unique ID
- **Edge Case Handling**: Works with selections at paragraph start/end
- **Preserved Functionality**: Clipboard copying works exactly as before

## CSS Styling

### Invisible Callouts:
The CSS makes `[!inline-quote]` callouts completely invisible:
- No borders, backgrounds, or padding
- Hidden callout titles/icons
- Text flows naturally like normal paragraphs
- Only the `==highlight==` marks are visible with subtle yellow background (`#fff3cd`)

### Highlight Styling:
- Uses Obsidian's native `==highlight==` syntax
- Custom yellow background color: `#fff3cd`
- Inherits font properties from surrounding text

## Files Modified:
1. **`src/main.ts`** - Complete rewrite of the `copyWithLink()` method
2. **`src/styles.css`** - New CSS for invisible callouts and highlight styling
3. **`test-implementation.md`** - Test file for various scenarios

## Benefits:
1. **No CSS Complexity**: Uses native Obsidian highlighting instead of custom inline styles
2. **Better Visual Integration**: Callouts are invisible, text looks natural
3. **Robust Multi-Paragraph**: Each paragraph gets proper callout with unique ID
4. **Maintained Functionality**: Linking and clipboard behavior unchanged
5. **Precise Control**: Only selected portions are highlighted

## Usage:
1. Select any text in Obsidian
2. Use Ctrl+Shift+C (or the command palette)
3. Text gets highlighted and wrapped in invisible callouts
4. Original selection + block links are copied to clipboard
5. Paste elsewhere with working links back to the highlighted content
